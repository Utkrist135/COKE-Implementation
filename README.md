# Crypto-Less Over-the-air Key Establishment over Bluetooth Low Energy
This repository contains the Zephyr implementation of the Cryptoless Over-the-Air Key Establishment (COKE) algorithm on zephyr enabled devices. My project comprised of working on a RTOS for MCU implementation of the previously mentioned algorithm using anonumous signaling.
